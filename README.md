# Hacker Rank 
Ive added some of my answers to the interview warm up questions on hacker rank. The Sock Merchant answer is my favorite solution of the four because it works with a hash set.

# Data Structures

Data structures are a key skill for any important technical interview but exponentially so for big tech companies, ive implemented several here for reference 

## Stack

Stack is like a stack of plates, FILO (First In Last Out) meaning that what gets put in last will be accessed first, see code for example of a use for this.
Solve the balanced parenthesis problem, from HackerRank's youtube channel. A great example of one situation where a stack makes for a simple solution.
Implemented a stack with a Linked List


## Queue

Queue is like a line at an amusement park, FIFO (First In First Out) meaning the first thing to be added to the queue will be the first thing to leave it
Implement a Queue using two stacks, one for newest entries and one for oldest
Implemented a Queue using Linked List

## Linked List

Linked list can either be singly or doubly linked, meaning can point to its next or next and previous node. It has constant time for insertion and deletion as long as it is at the head or tail. Search is linear time.


## Trees

### Binary Search Trees
This is what most folks first think of when they think of trees. Each node has at most a left and right child node, either can be null. Binary seach trees have a Log N time for insertion, deletion, and search as long as the tree is balanced well.

### Red-Black Tree

### Cartesian Tree

### Splay Tree

### AVL Tree

### KD Tree

### Trie

A tree of characters, good for doing word validation and finding the count of words with given prefixes
