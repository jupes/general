# Hacker Rank 
Ive added some of my answers to the interview warm up questions on hacker rank. The Sock Merchant answer is my favorite solution of the four because it works with a hash set.

# Data Structures

Data structures are a key skill for any important technical interview but exponentially so for big tech companies, ive implemented several here for reference 

## Stack

Stack is like a stack of plates, FILO (First In Last Out) meaning that what gets put in last will be accessed first, see code for example of a use for this.
Solve the balanced parenthesis problem, from HackerRank's youtube channel. A great example of one situation where a stack makes for a simple solution.
Implemented a stack with a Linked List


## Queue

Queue is like a line at an amusement park, FIFO (First In First Out) meaning the first thing to be added to the queue will be the first thing to leave it
Implement a Queue using two stacks, one for newest entries and one for oldest
Implemented a Queue using Linked List
